# Backend Application with MongoDB, Node.js, and Express

This is a backend application built with **Node.js**, **Express**, and **MongoDB**. The application supports **CRUD operations** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and integrates with **Postman** for API testing. The project is structured in a modular and abstracted way, ensuring maintainability and scalability.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for building the backend server.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for handling API routes.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing and retrieving data.
- **Postman**: API testing tool to test and document the API endpoints.
- **Mongoose**: MongoDB object modeling for Node.js.
- **Git**: Version control for managing code changes.

## Features

- **CRUD Operations**: Create, Read, Update, and Delete users and related resources.
- **Modular Structure**: Use of controllers, models, and utility classes to maintain code abstraction.
- **API Testing**: Fully tested API endpoints using Postman for seamless interaction.
- **Database Integration**: Data is stored and managed in MongoDB, with the use of Mongoose for schema modeling.
